## Abstract
This site is a version of the Rock Paper Scissors game. Play the classic game in the colosseum, or select a hero to fight in Cell's arena. Your wins will automatically be saved, along with your icon, and name if you choose to enter one. You can reset you progress at any point, and see your total wins across both games.

## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - Atom
  - CSS

## Install + Setup
  - The user is able to visit [Rock Paper Scissors](https://jabene.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) and can immediately plug its own inputs into the app.  

## Contributors
  - [Joshua Benefield](https://github.com/Jabene)

## Wins
  - I was able to complete the projects functionality with no bugs.
  - I worked on styling that I previously hadn't explored, and learned some things I'm eager to bring into my next project.

## Challenges + Improvements
  - I ended creating so much tech debt that it was difficult to refactor my Javascript without starting from scratch.
  - I ended up having a lot of similar functions and methods. I explored betters solutions, and I'm looking forward to improving how DRY my code is in future projects.
